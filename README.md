#PHP,MySQL and Redis Caching DB Result

Description
The Project Name project is a web application developed using PHP, MySQL, Redis, Twig, JS and Composer. It serves as a starting point for building web applications with the mentioned technologies.
The project is a fully functional MVC (Model-View-Controller) system with routing and an implemented Twig template engine. It provides a structured approach to developing web applications by separating the business logic (model), presentation layer (view), and application flow (controller). The routing functionality enables mapping URLs to specific controller actions, allowing for clean and organized handling of user requests. Additionally, Twig simplifies the process of creating dynamic and reusable templates, making it easier to manage the presentation of data in the application.

Installation
To set up the project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Install XAMPP server by downloading it from the official website. XAMPP is a widely used software package that provides an environment for running PHP and MySQL applications.

2. Install PHP Redis extension:

 * Download the PHP Redis extension compatible with your PHP version from the official PECL website.

 * Follow the installation instructions provided with the extension to compile and install it.

 * Once installed, enable the Redis extension by adding the following line to your PHP configuration file (php.ini):
extension=redis.so

3. Install Redis server by following the installation instructions available on the official Redis website. Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a caching layer for your web application.


Setup
Once you have installed the necessary software, follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. Clone the project repository:


git clone https://github.com/WALLReTuRn-new/phpredis.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd phpredis
3. Install project dependencies using Composer (if not already installed):

composer install
Note: Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP that helps in managing external libraries and packages used in your project. If Composer is already installed, you can skip this step.


4. Set up the database by importing the SQL file provided with the project. You can use tools like phpMyAdmin or the MySQL command line to import the file.

5. Configure the database connection in the project's configuration file. Typically, this file is located at config/database.php. Update the necessary credentials such as database name, username, and password.

6. Start the XAMPP server and make sure both Apache and MySQL services are running.

7. Run the project by accessing it through a web browser. The URL would typically be http://localhost/phpredis.

Usage
After successfully setting up and running the project, you can start using it for your desired purpose. Customize the project as per your requirements by modifying the PHP, Twig, and JavaScript files.
